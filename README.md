# Portfolio

For this repository, I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be updated over time:

### Tasks


* Site is divided into sections of About Me, My Work, Contact Info, and Logo.
* At the top of the website, I put functional navigation links that would lead the visitor to any of the sections.
* I have included current photo of me and my own logo.
* The projects presented in the My Work section include a couple of sample programs I have worked on for the bootcamp as well as some placeholder applications that will be added to as I complete more applications in the bootcamp and on my own.
* The website was designed to work on a variety of screen sizes, including tablets and smartphones.


### Links
