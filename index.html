      <h2> ABOUT ME</h2>
     <!-- <p>
        Hello, my name is Tanya Gonzalez / 李佳佳 (in Mandarin Chinese). Bilingual international affairs graduate student with a passion for community involvement and self-care. Interested in promoting safety through the knowledge of various cultures, emerging technology, and homeland security best practices. <br>

       <p>
        Tanya Gonzalez was born and raised in Puerto Rico. She graduated from Margarita Janer Palacios High School in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, to pursue a Business Administration career. However, due to political and socio-economic issues in Puerto Rico, she had to move to Tennessee. While completing her Associate's degree online in Business Administration from the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, she became an Assistant Manager for a Dollar General store. As she became more curious about the world, she decided to continue her studies at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) and successfully gaining a Bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice with a concentration in Homeland Security and double minors in Asian Studies and Information Systems, and graduating during a the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. </p> <br>
        <p>
         During those undergraduate years, she participated in multiple extracurricular activities, becoming Former President of La Comunidad, mentor for the Asian Student Association, Caribbean Student Association, Hispanic and Asian Heritage Month Committee while volunteering for LGBT+ events, Habitat for Humanity, Feed the Children, Tennessee Democratic Party, National Honor Society, Secular Student Alliance, Puerto Rico Rises, among many other entities. She is currently working as a Research Assistant for Dr. Donna Dopwell under the Social Work Department at MTSU while attending Graduate School, pursuing her degree in Master's of International Affairs with the People's Republic of China as her region focused. Her short goal is to take all opportunities given, learn from others, and graduate. At the same time, her long-term goal is to create connections between Asia and Puerto Rico in exchanging resources, leadership, business opportunities, and knowledge in rebuilding Puerto Rico from its natural disasters.
